# Game Snake
Using JS, HTML and CSS without third-party libraries.
## How to play and the rules of the game
The player controls a non-stop snake that can only move up, down, right, left and collect food. Each time a snake eats fruit, it will increase by the same length. This is what complicates the game, as you must avoid collisions with your own tail, the edges of the field and the walls that serve as obstacles. As soon as one of these options happens, the game starts again.
## Implementation stages
**Stage 1**: Creating a field.  <br />
**Stage 2**: Making a snake move automatically. <br />
**Stage 3**: Ability to change the direction of the snake. <br />
**Stage 4**: Creating random snake food. <br />
**Stage 5**: Increase in snake after eating food. <br />
**Stage 6**: Creating walls as obstacles. <br />
**Stage 7**: Ensuring that the game is completed after the snake collides with its own tail, field edge, and walls. <br />
**Stage 8**: Final testing. <br />
## Goal
To the second stage, the above 1-6 steps will be completed.

## Implemented in 2nd stage: 
All stages 1 through 5 inclusive were completed.
## Additional goals up to stage 3:
**Stage 9**: Opportunity 'to get' lives. <br />
**Stage 10**: Levels. <br />
**Stage 11**: Timer (the time it takes a snake to eat new food and eventually move to a new level or lose life / die). <br />
