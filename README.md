# Game Snake
Using JS, HTML and CSS without third-party libraries.
## How to play and the rules of the game
The player controls a non-stop snake that can only move up, down, right, left and collect food. Each time a snake eats fruit, it will increase by the same length. This is what complicates the game, as you must avoid collisions with your own tail, the edges of the field and the walls that serve as obstacles. As soon as one of these options happens, the game starts again.
## Implementation stages
Stage 1: Creating a field
Stage 3: Making a snake move automatically
Stage 4: Ability to change the direction of the snake
Stage 5: Creating snake food
Stage 6: Increase in snake after eating food
Stage 7: Creating walls as obstacles
Stage 8: Ensuring that the game is completed after the snake collides with its own tail, field edge, and walls.
Stage 9: Final testing
## Goal
To the second stage, the above 1-6 steps will be completed.
