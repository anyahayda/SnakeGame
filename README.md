# Game Snake

[Try game](https://anyahayda.github.io/SnakeGame/)

## How to play and the rules of the game
The player controls a non-stop snake that can only move up, down, right, left and collect food. Each time a snake eats fruit, it will increase by the same length. This is what complicates the game, as you must avoid collisions with your own tail, the edges of the field and the walls that serve as obstacles. As soon as one of these options happens, the game starts again.

There are also levels in the game. Each level has its time and during this time the snake must collect a certain amount of points (eating food).  <br />
**With each level increases:**
1. The number of obstacles.
2. The number of points you need to collect to advance to the next level.
3. Time (for more difficult levels - more time, because you have more to do).
4. Score (one food - 10 scores).
5. With each passed level plus 2 lives and you can also 'get' lives during the level).
## Implementation stages
**Stage 1**: Creating a field.  <br />
**Stage 2**: Making a snake move automatically. <br />
**Stage 3**: Ability to change the direction of the snake. <br />
**Stage 4**: Creating random snake food. <br />
**Stage 5**: Increase in snake after eating food. <br />
**Stage 6**: Creating walls as obstacles. <br />
**Stage 7**: Ensuring that the game is completed after the snake collides with its own tail, field edge, and walls. <br />
**Stage 8**: Final testing. <br />
## Goal
To the second stage, the above 1-6 steps will be completed.
## Implemented in 2nd stage: 
All stages 1 through 5 inclusive were completed.
## Additional goals up to stage 3:
**Stage 9**: Opportunity 'to get' lives. <br />
**Stage 10**: Levels. <br />
**Stage 11**: Timer (the time it takes a snake to eat food and eventually move to a new level or lose life / die). <br />
**Stage 12**: Score.
## Implemented in 3nd stage:
Everything that is written in sections "How to play" and "Implementation stages" are done!
